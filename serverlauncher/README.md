# Server Launcher

This is a little thing I made to directly launch Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and join a server.
It used it's protocal for browsers, minecraft://.
The API of a website that is a list of servers for Bedrock Edition is IP Restricted sadly.
So I would have to manually add servers and stuff.
