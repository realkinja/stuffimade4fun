<!-- ABOUT THE REPO !-->
## About This Repository

So, what is this?
I decided to make a repository for projects I made when I was bored.
I will be moving some older repos here that were made as a joke.


### Made With

Most things I make are made with [Batch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file)
But, I am looking forward to trying out [Python!](https://www.python.org/)
